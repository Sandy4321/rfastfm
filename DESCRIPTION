Description: rfastfm is an interface to the fastFM library for Factorization 
  Machines (FM). Though being recognized as being very successful for 
  recommender system type applications, FMs are a much more general model to 
  deal with sparse and high dimensional features. The fastFM implementation 
  provides easy access to many solvers and supports regression, classification 
  and ranking tasks. Such an implementation simplifies the use of FMs for a 
  wide range of applications.
